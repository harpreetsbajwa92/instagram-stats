# Instagram Stats
Live: https://harpreetsbajwa92.github.io/instagram-stats/ (repo harpreetsbajwa92/instagram-stats, GitHub Pages from main).
Dark, mobile-first. Page fetches data.json live (cache-busted, refreshes every 60s). All dates are Toronto dates.

## Tabs (layout rebuilt to match the LinkedIn Stats app)
- **Today** – header Regular / Professionals toggle, day ‹ › navigation, KPI grid (Follows done, Requests accepted + rate, Texts sent, Active chats), daily goal progress bar (8 regular / 2 professionals), People followed list with status, Good prospects.
- **Trends** – Regular / Professionals / Combined filter; Weekly / Monthly / Yearly with ‹ › period navigation; summary, accept & reply rate, days hit goal, streaks, goal projection; bar charts (follows, accepted, texts, active chats); all-time totals.
- **History** – day list newest first with same filter (Combined shows Reg+Pro split, green = goal hit); tap a day for handles.
- **Settings (⚙)** – how stats update, export JSON, goals.
- Footer line "App version: …" and no-cache meta tags; page re-fetches data.json every 60s.

## Good prospects
Never deleted automatically. **Only Harpreet may remove entries** (the Delete button on the page only hides it on his device; the data stays in data.json). Do not remove entries from data.json without his instruction.

## data.json
`tracks.<regular|professionals>` has `people`, `prospects`, and `days`: `{ "YYYY-MM-DD": {follows, accepted, texts, chats, flagged} }`.
